## Machine Learning Model(s) to Predict Game Winners, Point Spread and Over/Under Total

This is a passion project that I have talked about pursuing for many years, but did not have the time. The purpose of this project is to develop Machine Learning Models to predict NFL outcomes. V1.0 was a simple Logistic Regression to predict the winner and probability of winning for each game.
